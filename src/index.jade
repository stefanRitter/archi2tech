          | Hi, I'm Stefan. In the past two years I turned my career on its head - I left architecture and went into tech! By teaching myself how to code I got a job in a great startup here in London - the wonderful: <a href="http://www.escapethecity.org/" target="_blank">Escape The City</a>. Where I am now the lead HTML5 developer working closely with both our CTO and our product manager.
