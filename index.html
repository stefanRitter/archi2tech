      <h2>What will you learn?</h2>
      My goal is to teach you all you need to get a job in tech. We will start with creating websites, after that we will be building <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="_blank">Single-page applications</a>, and finish the course with server and database programming in <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.
      Once a week you will get a task and instructions from me into your inbox. Every week we will learn a new concept and apply it right away to a concrete real life project.
      Each month we start a new project. By the end of the year you will have a portfolio of 12 projects and a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> account full of open source code to apply for your first job in tech.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      In the past two years I changed my career and went from architecture into tech by teaching myself how to code and got a job in a great tech startup - the wonderful: <a href="http://www.escapethecity.org/" target="_blank">Escape The City</a>.
      The goal for this course is simple: what took me 2 years (including one year of bad paid part time work) I'll teach you how to do in one - without quitting your job!
